## Hi there 👋


My name is Henri Laitinen and welcome to my GitHub page!

On this page, you’ll find various projects that I’ve worked on, including both school-related and personal projects. These projects vary from small games to robot controlling programs.


📚 About My Projects:
Most of my personal projects are written in C++ (with a couple in C#).
School projects are mainly written in Python.
I’m actively trying to diversify my skill set with every project and I'm always eager to learn new things in the world of coding.


⚙️ NOTE: 
I should note that on most of these projects I havent used git. As a result, many of my projects are uploaded here as complete units (no commits, branches, etc.). However, I do have basic knowledge of Git from my school projects on my schools git, and I aim to improve version control in future ones.
